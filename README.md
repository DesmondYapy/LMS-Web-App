## EC Price Prediction API

This project is an API built using FastAPI to predict the resale prices of Executive Condominiums (EC) in Singapore. The API uses a trained Machine Learning model to provide predictions based on various property attributes such as the project name, area, floor range, type of sale, district, and more.

## Features

- **Price Prediction:** The API predicts EC resale prices at two specific points in time:
  - 5 years after the lease commencement (Minimum Occupancy Period, MOP).
  - 10 years after the lease commencement (Privatization period).
- **RESTful API:** Exposes the prediction model through an easily accessible RESTful API endpoint.
- **Containerized Application:** The entire application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run on any environment.

## Requirements

- Docker (ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the EC Price Prediction API on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository from GitHub

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ec-price-prediction-api.git`

`cd ec-price-prediction-ap `

### 2. Build the Docker Image and Run the Container

`docker build -t ec-price-api .`

`docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ec-price-api`

### 3. Test the API

`bash test.sh`

### Additional Information

“In production, the frontend and backend should ideally be deployed in separate containers to support independent scaling, deployment, and observability. For simplicity and clarity in this assessment, both are served in a single container.”
